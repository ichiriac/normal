Practical scenarios showing Normal’s strengths:

- CRUD admin: Define Models, sync schema, and wire simple create/update flows.
- Blog: Users, Posts, Tags with many-to-many and comments with one-to-many.
- CRM: Contacts and Users with inheritance; activities/messages as mixins.
- Inventory: Warehouses, stock moves and quants (see demo/stocks).

See the demo folders in the repo for runnable examples.
